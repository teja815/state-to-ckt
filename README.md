# Quantum State to Circuit

This project allows you to convert quantum state vectors into quantum circuits using a modern, interactive web interface.

## Features
- Input quantum states and amplitudes
- Visualize the resulting column vector
- See backend output and circuit diagrams
- Light and dark mode with glassmorphism UI

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter the number of qubits, basis state, and amplitude.
3. Add terms and convert to see the column vector and circuit.

## Development
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- UI inspired by modern design trends
